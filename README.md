# Hi, I'm Syed Sufyan! 👋

I’m a second-year Computer Science student with a passion for building intelligent, user-focused software systems.  
Eager to explore and contribute to the world of Artificial Intelligence, I’m particularly interested in:

- 🧠 Machine Learning (ML)
- 🕸️ Deep Learning (DL)
- 👥 User-focused Software Solutions

Alongside AI, I actively engage in **competitive programming**, constantly challenging myself to improve algorithmic thinking and problem-solving efficiency.

I’m currently learning, building, and collaborating on projects that bring AI concepts into real-world applications. Whether it’s solving a tough coding problem or designing a better user experience, I’m always excited to take on a new challenge.
